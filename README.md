## About Tripflow 🌍
At Tripflow, we believe that travel should be an exciting and enriching experience shared with friends. Our mission is to provide a platform that empowers you to plan unforgettable trips together.
Tripflow is the easiest, most intuitive, and fun way to plan memorable trips.

Think Figma or Miro, but for travel planning. Our platform is collaborative, and entirely visual. Simply share a link with your friends or family members and start collaborating in real time.

## How is it different?
Unlike other trip planning tools, tripflow is:

- Entirely Visual —> because that’s the universal language of the travel experience;
